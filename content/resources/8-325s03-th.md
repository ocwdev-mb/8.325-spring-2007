  caption: The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider
    will, once it is built, look for the Higgs boson and evidence of physics beyond
    the standard model. This image is a simulation depicting the decay of a Higgs
    particle following a collision of two protons in the CMS experiment. (Image courtesy
