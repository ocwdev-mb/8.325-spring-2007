## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Description

This course is the third and last term of the quantum field theory sequence. Its aim is the proper theoretical discussion of the physics of the standard model.

## Prerequisite

[8.324](/courses/8-324-relativistic-quantum-field-theory-ii-fall-2010) (Quantum Field Theory II)

## Grading

Your grade will be based on problem sets to be given out roughly every 2 weeks. There are no exams.

## Textbooks and References

The required textbook is:

Peskin, Michael E., and Daniel V. Schroeder. _An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory (Frontiers in Physics)_. New York, NY: HarperCollins Publishers, 1995. ISBN: 9780201503975. (Corrections page: [_An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~mpeskin/QFT.html).)
